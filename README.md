# NumericalMethodsENGR240
Provides Methods for Numerical Methods. Includes tools for root-finding, integration, Ordinary differential equations (initial value problems for single equations or systems of equations), optimization, linear algebra, differentiation, and curve fitting. The code was developed for an ENGR240 class (Introduction to Numerical Methods).
examples.py has examples on every function. All the other files can be imported and are ready to use. Every function has a docstring explaining what it does, returns, what its parameters mean, and how to use it.
Every function has been tested to work with appropriate accuracy as long as the assumptions are met (For example: most methods require function or data to be real valued, many methods require functions to be continous, etc).
