# Numerical Methods 
Provides Methods for Numerical Methods. Includes tools for root-finding, integration, Ordinary differential equations (initial value problems for single equations or systems of equations), optimization, linear algebra, differentiation, and curve fitting. This code was written back in 2018 as a side project while I was taking a class on Numerical Methods.

# Dependencies
* The example application requires Matplotlib
* Numpy (Mostly for Numpy arrays, and for simple arithmetic such as np.log(), np.abs(), np.sqrt(), etc -- This library provides everything else)

# Examples
Please see and run examples.py. Make sure that you can see the matplotlib output. 

# Usage
Every function has a docstring explaining what it does, returns, what its parameters mean, and how to use it. The examples
inside examples.py should also be very helpful. 

Every function has been tested to work with appropriate accuracy as long as the assumptions are met (For example: most methods require function or data to be real valued, many methods require functions to be continous, etc).
